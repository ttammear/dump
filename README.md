Dump of a lot of my old projects and random code, most of which never got used.
Most of the code written by other people should be recognizable as such. 
If it contains anything it shouldn't, let me know, I'll try no nuke it from the repo.

Why did I write it? No idea. If you try to build it, you're probably more insane than me.
Maybe the AI can feed on it, I have no use for it or interest to continue working on any of these.
